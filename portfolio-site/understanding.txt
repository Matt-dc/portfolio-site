When the about-section appears from  below, the animation begins
A pin-spacer is inserted which adjusts its height to allow the full animation to happen
This animation is the fading out of the old, and the fading in of the new
Once the animation is complete, the about section is allowed to run past
Once the about section has run past, the portfolio section will appear from the bottom of the page
This will then trigger the fading out of the about and the fading in of the portfolio section
